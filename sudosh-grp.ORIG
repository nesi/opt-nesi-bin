# Add (-a) or remove (-d) a user from the "impersonated"
# group, which should allow them to be able to be "impersonated"
# by any member of the "impersonator" group by using sudosh.
#
# This is via a sudo rule that should be in place:
#    ipa sudorule-add-runasuser impersonate --group=impersonated
#
# Here when a request is made to add or remove a user from
# the impersonated group, we first check for the existence of a semaphore
# file in the user's $HOME directory. The user must have given their
# consent to enter the impersonated group by creating this semaphore
# file (.sudosh_allow).
# See sudosh-allow and sudosh-disallow, which are available for execution
# by users, and merely creates/deletes this semaphore file and then
# calls this script as root (everyone will be able to execute this script)
# which authenticates to ipa as a privileged user and adjusts the group
# membership accordingly.
# After the group is changed, the sss_cache is refreshed for the user,
# because we want this to take effect now, and who knows how long it'll be
# before sss gets around to getting itself current.
